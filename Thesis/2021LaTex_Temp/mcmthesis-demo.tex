\section{Overview}
\subsection{Background}


 The wildfires in Australia recently has drawn great focus. Frequent wildfires bring fire extinguishing system great pressure, thus the assistance
of automatic devices, like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV), 
radio and unmanned reconnaissance, should be taken into considerition. 
\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}

To help the firefighting system in East Victoria State, we are required
to solve several problems. The unmanned devices to respond to the bushfires can be divided to two kinds,
the SSA Thermal Imaging system and the Radio Repaeters, with each UAV carrying
one of them. To gurantee that the Safty Cofficient meets the satandard, we should
balance the number of SSA and RR carried by UAVs, in order to acquire best economic benifits.\\
Moreover, the prediction of the bushfires in the next decade in East Victotia is required
we will explain how to apply our model to respond to the bushfires.We are also required 
to point out where the UAVs with Radio Repaeters should be.

\section{Notations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unmanned Aerial Vehicle} $\rightarrow$ UAV
  \item \textbf{Radio Repeater} $\rightarrow$ RR
  \item \textbf{Rapid Bushfire Response} $\rightarrow$ RBR
  \item \textbf{Surveillance and Situational Awareness} $\rightarrow$ SSA
  \item \textbf{The total number of SSA and RR}$\rightarrow$ m
  \item \textbf{The firespot}$\rightarrow$ x
  \item \textbf{The fireregion}$\rightarrow$ y
  \item \textbf{Vector (x,y)}$\rightarrow$ $\alpha$ 
  \item \textbf{Danger Cofficient}$\rightarrow$ d
\end{itemize}
\newpage


\section{Hypothesis and Justifications}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{The EOC will be set near the fire and will not move}
  \item \textbf{The Radio Repaeters'(RR) flights are always at their highest speed and will keep their location at the fires}
  \item \textbf{The wildfires are considered as discrete dots(Firepoints)} 
  \item \textbf{The UAV with SSA system must work within 5Km from the firepoint}
  \item \textbf{Ignore the side effects like Doppler Effecet and the influence of the winds}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model Overview}
\subsection{Optimal numbers Model}
To design a purchasing configuration for SSA and RR, we need to introduce a \textbf{Danger Cofficient}
to evaluate whether the number of devices can gurantee that the firefightres are safe enough to work at
the firespots. Due to various kinds of goods in the problem, this is a threedimensional
heterogeneous container loading problem. We use the Three Space Division
Method and Monte Carlo Simulation to solve it.
